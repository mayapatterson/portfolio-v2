**Product background**

Our service relies on getting new users through our onboarding funnel and getting them connected to their Trunk Club stylist. Our onboarding process wasn't supporting this need.

From a design and technical perspective, the onboarding experience was outdated, inconsistent, and ultimately wasn't a positive reflection of our brand. The women's experience used an entirely different set of visual design elements in comparison to our men's flow. The men's experience had barely been touched for two years. Furthermore, our onboarding application was technically archaic, making it difficult for the team to iterate and test new concepts.

We understood that redesigning and rebuilding the entire onboarding experience for Trunk Club was an enormous undertaking. However, a strong onboarding experience for our users was instrumental to Trunk Club's success as a growing business and our user's happiness.
